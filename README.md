# vikassuthar
Hi there 👋
I’m an Android developer with over 3 years of experience in building high-quality and meaningful products mostly in startups.

I pride myself on having an artistic eye despite being “just” a developer and I love opportunities where I can utilize both the artistic and the technical aspects of my brain. Furthermore, I love being part of the Android community by networking with Android devs in annual conferences and writing blog posts on topics related to Android (medium.com/@prsuthar44).

Interested in working together? Let's grab a coffee and talk tech, music, TV shows, or latest adventures.

Skills 💻
Languages: Kotlin; Java; Swift
Interests: Machine Learning; UI/UX; Photography
